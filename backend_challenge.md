# Backend Challenge: Simple Movie Catalog Service

## Overview

We're looking for a simple service to manage a catalog of movies. Your task is to design and implement a REST API that supports basic operations for this catalog.

## Objectives

1. **Movie Management**: Create the capability to manage movie entries. Each movie should have details like title, director, release year, genre, and a short description. How you structure these details and what technologies you use are up to you.
2. **Basic Operations**: Your API should support adding new movies, retrieving information about movies, updating movie details, and removing movies from the catalog.
3. **Search**: Implement a simple way to search for movies by title or genre.

## Requirements

- **Design and Implementation**: Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks to build this service. Your choice of database, programming language, and tools should be justified in your documentation.
- **Flexibility**: The API should be flexible enough to accommodate future changes or additional features without significant rework.
- **Documentation**: Provide basic documentation that includes an overview of your design decisions, how to run your service, and how to use the API.

## Deliverables

- The source code for your service, ideally hosted in a public Git repository.
- A README file that includes:
  - Setup instructions.
  - A brief explanation of your technology stack and architecture choices.
  - A simple guide on how to use the API.

## Suggestions

- Think about how your API design can support scalability and maintenance.
- Consider what additional features or improvements could make the service more robust or easier to use.
- Reflect on and document any assumptions you make during the development process.

## Submission Instructions

Please provide the URL to your repository containing the source code and documentation. Make sure the repository is accessible to us by ensuring it's public or sharing access as needed.
